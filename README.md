# Animal Showcase

## Project Description 

This project is a web page called "Animal Showcase" that displays different animal images, names, and their countries. Users have the option to learn more about each animal by clicking on them.

## Technologies Used

The web page is built using HTML and CSS, making it compatible with any modern web browser. It is responsive and can adapt to various screen sizes. The code was developed using Visual Studio Code as the text editor.

## How to Run

To see the project in action:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the cloned folder in your preferred code editor.
3. Navigate to the `index.html` file and open it in your web browser.

## Coding Challenges

### Part 1: Contiguous Subarray Sum (JavaScript)

Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

To run this challenge:
1. Navigate to the `codingChallenge` folder.
2. Run `node arrayMap` in your terminal to execute the contiguous subarray sum challenge.

### Part 2: String Transformation (JavaScript)

Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:
- If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
- If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
- If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above.

To run this challenge:
1. Navigate to the `codingChallenge` folder.
2. Run `node stringTransform` in your terminal to execute the string transformation challenge.

Before running the coding challenges, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from nodejs.org.
